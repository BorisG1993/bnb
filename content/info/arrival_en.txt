As is widely accepted, check-in is available from 15:00 and check-out until 11:00.
Contact the host when you arrive at the yellow gate for them to open it.
During your stay, the yellow gate can be opened using the blue chip attached to the unit key.
The entrance to the unit is through a bamboo gate with a "Welcome" sign on it, at the beginning of “שיאון” Street on the right.
The key will be in the door, and the door will be unlocked upon your arrival.
